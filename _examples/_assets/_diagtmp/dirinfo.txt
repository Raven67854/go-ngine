Files and folders inside this _diagtmp directory are
temporary files created by go:ngine at runtime for
diagnostic purposes.

By default go:ngine doesn't do this, but in the example apps
we have activated this functionality.

_diagtmp/{appname}/glsl: contains the (dynamically
generated) full GLSL shader sources as sent to GL.
